# SmashRisk
Play Smash Bros using Risk rules using this mobile application.

# How it works:
- Every stage is treated like a country in Risk.
- Every stage has a designated character that is bound to it.
- All of the stages will be sorted out to each player.
- On each players turn they will attack another stage from another player.
- The attacker may use any character from his stage list.
- The defender MUST use the character bound to his attacked stage.
- If the attacker wins, he takes that stage and character from the other player.
- If the defender wins with all of his stocks left, he may do a counterattack.
- A counter attack involves the same 2 characters/stages but the roles are reversed.
- If the counterattacker wins, he takes the stage.
- Losing a counterattack continues the game without chance for another counterattack.
- The game ends when a player holds all of the stages.
- It can also end in any way that the players agree to, such as a final single battle.

# Some other rules.
- An attacker can only use a character to attack after a set number of turns after being used.
- (Unless he has less than the amount of characters per turns of cooldown).
- No amiibos.

#This app will:
- Sort out the stages between the number of players.
- Let players customize their names.
- Handle turn rotation and battle results.
- Show the list of maps to attack.
- Be able to set the number of players and other special rules.
